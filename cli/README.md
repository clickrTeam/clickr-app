# Clickr CLI
This folder contains all of the code for the clickr CLI application

To build the application you will need cargo rust's package manager. You can install it via [rustup](https://rustup.rs)

## How to Build and Run

Build the application with:

```
cargo build
```

This will produce a binary in the `target/` directory. You can run this directly or use `cargo run -- <flags for clickr>` to run the application.
