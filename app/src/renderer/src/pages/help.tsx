            Clickr is a cross platform keyboard remapper. With Clickr, you can change any key on your keyboard
            to another key, shortcut, or combination of keys. You can do this whether you're on Windows, Mac,
            or Linux. Clickr is designed to be simple to use, so anyone can have the freedom to use their keyboard
            in a way that works best for them.

            Clickr is fully cross platform compatible, this means that you can create a profile on your Mac and
            load it on your Windows PC, and it will just work! You can also download other Profiles from our website
            and modify those to your liking. The actual remapping process is done through another application called 
            'Keybinder'. The Keybinder runs silently in the background, so you won't have to have the Clickr application
            open in order to remap your keys.

            A Profile is a collection of Layers. The simplest way to think of a Profile is that it
            is person-specific. For example, if John and Jane both used the same computer, there
            would be a profile for John, and one for Jane. In the profile, each person will
            customize their keyboard experience to best suit them.

            A Layer is a customizable keyboard layout made up of the key bindings that you create.
            Each layer is associated with the Profile that creates it. A common use of a Layer is to
            be task specific. For example, you could create a Layer for when you use a Web Browser,
            and map buttons to "Forward", "Back", etc. Another common use is to have a Layer
            dedicated to a specific keyboard layout, like DVORAK or COLEMAK.

            Each Profile can have as many Layers as you want, but always must have at least one. You
            can switch between Layers whenever you want by setting a bind to "Switch Layer" and
            activating that bind. It is important to consider how you will navigate your Layers. If
            you have a button to switch from Layer 1 to Layer 2, but don't have a button to get
            back, you will be stuck on Layer 2. Make sure you consider navigation when creating your

            This is where things can be as simple or complicated as you want.
            It is recommended to do simpler Binds when you are just starting out.

          </p>
          <ol className="list-decimal ml-6">
              <li>Tap: This the simplest kind of bind. It will change one key to another.</li>
              <li>Press: This is specifically a key down. This should be paired with a Release Bind.</li>
              <li>Release: This is specifically a key up. When paired with a Press you are able to do 2 actions off one 
                physical key press.
              </li>
              <li>Macro: These are Binds that contain other Binds. For example, you could bind a key to
                be three Taps corresponding to Ctrl + Alt + Del if you were on Windows. 
                Macro Binds can be quite complicated.
              </li>
              <li>Timed Macro: These are Macros with a time delay between each Bind.
                For example, you could have a one second delay between 'Copy' and 'Paste'.
              </li>
              <li>Repeat: This will repeat a single Bind however many times you want with
                (or without) a time delay between them.
